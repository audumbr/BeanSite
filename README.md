Hey guys this is our read me file! We are Autumn Coy and Addison Mckee and we're from Adamsville Highschool. We are very pasionate about this project as this is the first official website we've ever made. 
we thought it would be a good idea to do a local small business that doesn't have a website for themselves, and it's a place we frequent often, so all around it seemed like a good idea! 
while we're not sure whether or not they're interested in using it, it was a fun learning experience. 
A few things went wrong here and there such as: completely breaking the website two days before the due date, (yes we cried a little).
